# House-Pricing-Regression
This is regression project on house price prediction.
The dataset I used to work on this project can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data) <br>
I hosted the regression web app on AWS and the link is [here](http://ec2-44-204-3-215.compute-1.amazonaws.com/) <br>
This project features:
### Data cleaning
As a data scientist, one will always come accross ___rogue data___. Data most time is inconsistent, inaccurate or incomplete

### Outlier filtering.
Their are always outliers in every dataset. When building a prototype that is intended for a general population it will be irresponsible to take outliers into account as that could skew the whole representation. In this case of real estate(house prices) a typical outlier can be a house of 4000sqft, with 2 bedrooms and 2 bhk that is overly expensive; now that's a typical outlier. The essence of data cleaning is two remove such absurd datapoints from the dataset. 

### Feature engineering
### Regression model(training).
### A web app development.
### Python Flask server.
### Model deployment to AWS.

The notebooks and source codes of the entire project is also provided.
